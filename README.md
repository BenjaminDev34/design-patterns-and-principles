# ðŸ“Œ SOLID

In object-oriented programming SOLID is a group of 5 principles :
- [Single responsibility](./SOLID/single_responsibility/README.md)
- [Open closed](./SOLID/open_closed/README.md)
- [Liskov substitution](./SOLID/lizkov_substitution/README.md)
- [Interface segregation](./SOLID/interface_segregation/README.md)
- [Dependency inversion](./SOLID/dependency_inversion/README.md)

Following those principles is not an easy task, and that's why there are design patterns...
